<h2>Interests and Other Information (趣味・他の情報)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Before focusing solely on web, I was a sushi chef behind the counter while working as a web designer.  I apparently 'entertained' a lot of non-Japanese customers, and provided them with a lot of delicious sushis!😋</li>
  <li>I studied Jazz Big Band Composition in college as well as broadcast arts (took 5 years to graduate)</li>
  <li>Multi-instrumentalist, with piano as my primary instrument.  Also proficient in drumset (probably why I'd prefer to do something else on top of being just a developer) and some ukulele</li>
  <li>Love all sorts of sports, but boxing is my favorite, followed by ice hockey.  I love a sport that you can get physical with an opponent.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have my own youTube channel, but at this moment I would not want to monetize, though I have years of professional experience in producing and creating videos.</p>
